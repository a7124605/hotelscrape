2018-10-30,為客戶下訂了三間行政套房，有一位客戶提前回國，因決定匆促而未通知飯店退房 因為後來臨時旅程安排而自己入住，哪知飯店早已將原本房間直接排給別的客戶，且櫃檯態度不佳，開始時還表示不能給我們房卡，雖強調訂房人身份後有安排升等的房間，這種服務態度確實讓人不開心。,8.4,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda

2022-11-14,位置很好，就在百貨商圈，但是如果不是坐車是自己從捷運站導航來的方向感不好容易搞錯 我這次加價升等可以看到101大樓的房型，的確是很大間有小客廳跟雙人洗手台跟浴缸 早餐也很豐富中西式都有 艾美跟艾麗就在旁邊，為了搜集我兩間都住了，這間艾美比較可惜的是接待，我排隊退房的時候兩位前台一位在接待客人一位在用電腦不知道在忙什麼也看到我在排隊，已經有客人在等辦退房，也可以打聲招呼讓稍等一下之類的，結果我後來說了要退房，才跟我說以為我跟前一組客人是一起的。,8.4,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda
2021-01-18,整體表現，soso 優點就只是地點好，可以看到101的 view. 其他地方就一個五星級飯店來說需要再多加強。 洗澡浴室的水會漏出整個外面。,5.6,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda

2023-02-06,"Quite disappointed with this 5 star hotel. Book thru agoda so cannot accumulate points from SPG MARRIOTT group. Staff was not very helpful. Room was not tidied. Worst of all, Breakfast was a great disappointment. Few variety, most stations were under staffed where u need to catch their attention before they prepare the food for u (noodles station for example), coffee/tea had to self service instead of requesting from the service crew who usher u to your seats. Took a bite on the pork sausage, its sour (means spoilt)! Not gonna try out this hotel in my next biz trip anymore.",4.0,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda
2022-11-25,"My husband and I had a terrible time at le meridian during our recent visit. The staff are very poorly trained and not suitable for a 5 star hotel. They don’t communicate well to customers and talk among themselves while customers are waiting to be helped. To be clear, I am only referencing the front desk staff, all others were professional. The hotel internet is super slow and not encrypted. Not suitable for customers who are expecting 5 star experience since that is the price they paid.",6.4,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda

2017-01-22,"I always think Humble House is better as it is more in a modern style and heard a lot about it. However, this time I decided to give a try and split my stay to Le Méridien and Humble House since they are so close for me to move hotels. Le Meridien totally impressed me. Staffs at FO was super nice and friendly with a sense of humor. They managed to arrange an upgrade for us for our 7th anniversary even it's just with an additional small outdoor area (be honest, a lot of hotel they don't do it even they have rooms available as it is not obligated especially we booked through agoda instead of direct booking...I know as I have been working in the industry). Room is in very good size, clean, neat, modern, and with good thoughts on small details. Plugs, USB plugs on both sides of the bed. I always think that it is very important nowadays as we have so many electronic devices. Also, it's not just on the bed side but it is actually in the drawers on the bedside table. Bathroom is big with shower and bathtub. They are also using Japanese toilet bowl which is automatic with heated. The bed and the linens are very comfortable. I had a great sleep for the night. Even we just stayed there for a night with late arrival and early check out, we did really enjoy the little time there in the room. Things are just right and make you feel good in this hotel. Shame that we didn't have time to try out other facilities and outlets here, but we will definitely come back to this hotel next time without hesitating which hotel to choose. Great team here and hope they can maintain this!! Thank you for making our stay so memorable!!",9.2,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda
2017-01-09,"This is the second time I've stayed here. Very close to Taipei 101 and I paid extra for a view of the fireworks. This is one of the nicest Le Meridien's I have stayed at. It was pricey but that was New Year's prices. MRT is walking distance and the hotel is surrounded by shopping areas. There are a few boutique hotels right nearby that are comparable, but for SPG loyalists this is a nice option.",8.4,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda

Room wasnt available upon early check-in, when we come back at 1pm to pick up our room key,the front desk staff (who checked us in earlier) remembered us and gave us the room key right away! Haven't experience this 5 star service for a long time!! It would be great if they ask if it was our first time staying at their hotel, introducing the room would be an AWESOME idea! The room is spacious, clean, bright and with a balcony (5th floor), though it was raining, so we werent able to enjoy the balcony this time. Not much view from our room (comparing to Humble House Taipei), however, other than that, I definitely recommend this hotel!!",10.0,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda

2016-08-01,"This hotel is at a good location close to 101, staff is friendly and overall upkeep is good, but a few things were below par, which makes the price tag look rather expensive. First and most importantly, the wifi quality was terrible. It took at times 10 minutes before I could get a stable signal in my room. Room service menu was expensive and had limited choices for my liking. The room service menu was on the TV as well but the writing was so small I couldn't read it unless I was a bout 5 cm away from the screen - what a waste of time!!",7.2,台北寒舍艾美酒店,Agoda
